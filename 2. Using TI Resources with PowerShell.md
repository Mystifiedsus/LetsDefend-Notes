Threat Intelligence sources are the sources that provide intelligence information on items such as Hash, Domain, IP Addresses. For example, by querying the HASH of an application running on our system, we can question whether this application is a malicious application, or whether an IP address connecting to our system has a previous record of malicious activity.

  

## Example 1: IP Reputation Check

Now let's have an exercise about this. In our example, let's list the Usernames and IP Addresses of the users who have successfully logged into our system in the last hour and check whether there is an IP address with a malicious record among these IP addresses:

```powershell
# Event ID 4624 indicates a successful user login attempt.
$events = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{Logname='Security';ID=4624;StartTime=(Get-Date).AddHours(-1)}

# We loop through the events we obtain
foreach ($event in $events) {
	# We get the XML version of the event
	$eventXML = [xml]$event.ToXml()

	# We get relevant information from XML.
	$ipAddress = $eventXML.Event.EventData.Data | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq 'IpAddress'} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty '#text'
	$userName = $eventXML.Event.EventData.Data | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq 'TargetUserName'} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty '#text'

	# We print the username and IP address on the screen
	Write-Output "User $userName has logged in from IP address $ipAddress"
}
```

In the output, we see that there have been 14 successful logins in the last hour, 3 of them belong to the Administrator user, and the Administrator user logged in from 2 different IP addresses.

Let's improve our script a bit and query the real IP addresses from a threat intelligence (TI) source. Our criteria when querying is whether the IP address is a known Proxy service IP address.

We should create two functions to be able to get effective results. The first function will query the IP address received as input in the IP Query service, and if the IP Address belongs to a known Proxy Service, it will call the sendMail function and transfer this information to the sendMail function. The second function, the sendMail function, will send the string received as a parameter to the defined address as an e-mail.

After defining our functions, we will start our script. Just like in the previous example, let's query the EventLogs and pull the list of Windows event ID 4624 in the last hour.

In Windows, if the Login activity is performed locally, the phrase " **-** " is included in the IP Address section of the relevant event record. While we are converting the IP Address information to **the System.Net.IPAddress** data type in our script in order to pass it through various checks, the string in the form of " **-** " cannot be parsed as an IP address, which causes an error and our script does not work properly.

Also, if we don't have an IP address, we don't need to check it. Therefore, we start a **try … catch** block here and use the **continue** command in the **catch** part of this block, allowing the script to go to the beginning of the loop and move on to the next action in case of an error.

If there is an IP address in the query, no error will occur and our script will continue to run. However, there is another problem waiting for us here; Local IP Address Blocks. If you remember the TCP/IP course, we talked about class A, B, and C blocks of IP addresses reserved for local use. If the IP address in the Login Success record is in one of these blocks, there is no need to query this IP address in the TI Service, because TI services keep records for Real IP addresses.

We also implement this check for the **if … elseif… elseif** blocks in our script and check whether the IP address we obtained is in the scope of one of these three blocks.

If the IP address we have is in these blocks, we continue without taking any action, but if the IP address is not in these blocks, we send it to the IpCheck function to be queried in the TI source.

```powershell
function IpCheck($ip){

	$body = @{'fields' = 'status,proxy'}

	$ipInfo = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://ip-api.com/json/$ip/" -Body $body
		
	if ($ipInfo.proxy -eq 1) {
		Write-Output "IP address $ipAddress has been marked as malicious!"
		sendMail("Logged In IP address $ipAddress has been marked as malicious!")
	} else {
			Write-Output "IP address $ipAddress has been marked as clean!"
		
	}
}


function sendMail($message) {

	$smtpServer = "smtp.letsdefend.io"
	$smtpUser = "labuser"
	$smtpPassword = "**********"

	$from = "alerter@letsdefend.io"
	$to = "admin@letsdefend.io"

	$smtpCred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $smtpUser, $($smtpPassword | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force)
			
	Send-MailMessage -SmtpServer $smtpServer -From $from -To $to -Subject $subject -Body $body -Credential $smtpCred -UseSsl
}



$events = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{Logname='Security';ID=4624;StartTime=(Get-Date).AddHours(-1)}
foreach ($event in $events) {

	$eventXML = [xml]$event.ToXml()


	$ipAddress = $eventXML.Event.EventData.Data | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq 'IpAddress'} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty '#text'
	$userName = $eventXML.Event.EventData.Data | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq 'TargetUserName'} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty '#text'


	try {
		$ipBytes = [System.Net.IPAddress]::Parse($ipAddress).GetAddressBytes()
		if ($ipBytes[0] -eq 10) {
			# This is Local Block, Do Nothing
			continue
		}
		elseif ($ipBytes[0] -eq 172 -and $ipBytes[1] -ge 16 -and $ipBytes[1] -le 31) {
			# This is Local Block, Do Nothing
			continue
		}
		elseif ($ipBytes[0] -eq 192 -and $ipBytes[1] -eq 168) {
			# This is Local Block, Do Nothing
			continue
		}
		else {
			# This is Real IP
			Write-Output "User $userName has logged in from external IP address $ipAddress"
			ipCheck ($ipAddress)
		}
	}
	catch {
		# This is Local Login Success
		continue
	}
}
```

After running the script, if we detect logins from a real IP address, we will check these IP addresses in the TI service and if the IP address belongs to a known Proxy Service, we will notify it by e-mail.

## Example 2: Hash Reputation Check

Let's give an example about File Hashes. We can calculate the hashes of all files in the file system using different algorithms. This hash information is like a snapshot of the current state of a file, and even if a single bit changes in the file, the hash value also changes. TI sources use this feature to classify all the files they review. For example, when we calculate the hash value of the “winlogon.exe” file running on your system with the **-Algorithm SHA256** parameter in the **Get-FileHash** cmdlet , we get an output as follows:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/advanced+powershell+for+blue+team/2/ps39.png)

  
  

When we query the hash value we obtained; **_24263FE01C799F690318EC99688DFD2355277D7CD4618E77E7F2A3F20D9FC87C_** _,_ on VirusTotal, a TI Service, we get the following output:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/advanced+powershell+for+blue+team/2/ps40.png)

  
  

What we see is a good news. The VirusTotal service also reports that the hash value we obtained hasn’t involved in any malicious activity and there is no problem with the “winlogon.exe” we use. If our winlogon.exe had any malicious activity recognized by VirusTotal, the hash value would be different from what we currently get and VirusTotal would report it to us.

Below you can see the VirusTotal result of the eicar.com file used to test Endpoint Security products:

So, how can we utilize Powershell on scanning the TI sources? Of course, there is a lot that can be done on this. But to get an idea and consolidate what we've learned, let's do an example. When this sample script is run, it extracts the hash values of the executable files (.exe etc.) of actively running processes. So, let's check whether a malware is running on our system using these hash values:

```powershell
# Get running process list
$processes = Get-Process

# Start Foreach loop for process list
$results = foreach ($process in $processes) {
	# Find current process path
	$filePath = $process.MainModule.FileName
		
		
	if ($filePath) {
		# Calculate Hash Value with SHA256 Algorithm
		$hash = Get-FileHash -Path $filePath -Algorithm SHA256
		# Add FileName,Path and Hash values into PSObject
		[PSCustomObject]@{
			'Process Name' = $process.Name
			'File Path' = $filePath
			'SHA256 Hash' = $hash.Hash
		}
	}
}

# Groups array by SHA256 hash value and returns only unique values
$results | Group-Object -Property 'SHA256 Hash' | ForEach-Object {
	$_.Group | Select-Object -First 1
}
```

In the script above, we first got a list of actively running processes in the system. Then, we found each process Path in this list and calculated its hash by giving this Path to the Get-FileHash cmdlet.

We saved the values we found into a PSOBject instead of listing them directly. The reason why we do this is so that we can run multiple copies of the same executable. Since this would cause unnecessary crowding and confusion, we first accumulated the values we obtained in a PSObject and finally, using the **Group-Object** cmdlet, we made our output unique by taking only 1 of those with the same hash value.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/advanced+powershell+for+blue+team/2/ps42.png)

  
  

As you can see in the output, despite all our efforts, we still have a large list and it will take time to query them one by one. But that's what powershell is for, right?

Let's develop our script a little more and query the hash values we obtained on Virus Total, and if we find a malicious process, let's report it to a Slack channel:

```powershell
# Slack webhook URL and VirusTotal API key values
$slackWebhookUrl = ""
$virusTotalApiKey = ""


# Get running process list
$processes = Get-Process

# Start Foreach loop for process list
$results = foreach ($process in $processes) {
    # Find current process path
	$filePath = $process.MainModule.FileName
		
		
	if ($filePath) {
		# Calculate Hash Value with SHA256 Algorithm
		$hash = Get-FileHash -Path $filePath -Algorithm SHA256
		# Add FileName,Path and Hash values into PSObject
		[PSCustomObject]@{
			'Process Name' = $process.Name
			'File Path' = $filePath
			'SHA256 Hash' = $hash.Hash
		}
	}
}

# Groups array by SHA256 hash value and returns only unique values
$results | Group-Object -Property 'SHA256 Hash' | ForEach-Object {
	$_.Group | Select-Object -First 1
}

foreach ($result in $uniqueResults) {
	$hash = $result.'SHA256 Hash'
	# VirusTotal Hash Control
	$vtResponse = Invoke-RestMethod -Method 'Get' -Uri "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/$hash" -Headers @{"x-apikey" = $virusTotalApiKey}
	if ($vtResponse.data.attributes.last_analysis_stats.malicious -gt 0) {
		# If mailicus found, send to slack via webhook
		$slackMessage = @{
			text = "Suspicius Process Found! Process Name: $($result.'Process Name'), Executable Path: $($result.'File Path'), SHA256 Hash: $hash"
		}
		Invoke-RestMethod -Method 'Post' -Uri $slackWebhookUrl -Body (ConvertTo-Json -InputObject $slackMessage)
	}
}
```

We can run this script whenever we need it, or we can run it as a scheduled task at certain periods.

In this part of the training, he have covered how to query TI resources using Powershell. We will learn about the “ **Checking for Updates with Powershell** ” on the next chapter of our training.
