Computer forensic analysis is the process of collecting and evaluating digital evidence. This process is often used to identify illegal activities or policy violations. PowerShell is a powerful tool for forensic analysis on Windows-based systems. In this lesson, we will see some techniques and tools you can use to understand PowerShell's forensic analysis capabilities and apply them to your own forensic analysis processes. What you should not forget is that although the Forensic Analysis process has best practices, each digital forensic incident has different dynamics.

For this reason, in this course we will try to examine the methods and tools that can be used in almost every case as possible.

  

## EventLog Analysis

Forensic analysis usually begins with examining system logs. Windows Event Log is an important source of information that can be accessed with PowerShell's Get-WinEvent cmdlet. For example, we can filter events by a specific Event ID to find suspicious user activity:

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashTable @{LogName='Security'; ID=4625}
```

PowerShell can also be used to analyze files and folders. The Get-ChildItem cmdlet is used to list the files in a folder, and these files can be routed to the pipeline to act on them. For example, we can find files with a specific file extension:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Include *.exe -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Include *.locked -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## File system analysis

Identifying files created/modified within a certain date range during forensic analysis is a very important step, and powershell offers us capable tools in this regard:

```powershell
$StartDate = Get-Date -Year 2023 -Month 6 -Day 1 -Hour 8 -Minute 0 -Second 0
$EndDate = Get-Date -Year 2023 -Month 6 -Day 30 -Hour 17 -Minute 0 -Second 0

Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse |
Where-Object {$_.CreationTime -gt $StartDate -and $_.CreationTime -lt $EndDate} |
Select-Object FullName, CreationTime
```

With the above script, we can get a list of files created within the date and time range we provide.

  

## System Information

Forensic analysis requires collecting detailed information about the target system. This may include operating system version, network configuration, running processes and services, installed programs and more. PowerShell can be used to collect much of this information. For example, we can use the **Get-ComputerInfo** cmdlet to collect system information:

```powershell
Get-ComputerInfo
```

The **Get-ComputerInfo** cmdlet provides very detailed information about the system, as you can see in the screenshot below:

The last time the system was rebooted is an important information for Forensic Analysis. Because we have a higher chance of obtaining findings about the attacker and his activities in a system that has not been rebooted after the attack. We can find out the last reboot time of the system with the following command:

```powershell
[System.Management.ManagementDateTimeconverter]::ToDateTime((Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem).LastBootUpTime)
```

## Running Applications and Services

PowerShell offers a variety of cmdlets to support memory analysis. For example, the Get-Process cmdlet returns information about all running processes. However, more advanced memory analysis will require third-party tools. But as for what to analyze, we can easily get the list of running processes and services with powershell.

```powershell
Get-Process

Get-Service
```

Additionally, PowerShell can integrate with tools that can perform more complex operations such as memory dumping and analysis. For example, SysInternals and Debugging Tools for Windows tools such as "procdump" and "WinDbg" can be operated using PowerShell scripts.

However, memory analysis often requires more complex tools and techniques. For example, memory analysis tools such as Volatility can perform various analyses on a given memory dump file. Such tools can analyze running processes, open files, network connections, installed drivers, services, registry information and many other details. However, these are typically accomplished through separate tools other than PowerShell.

  

## Users

Another important issue is the users who are actively logged into the system at the time of the review. We can get the list of them with the following command:

```powershell
Invoke-Expression -Command 'query user'
```

The output of this command will be as follows:

For the forensic analysis process, how a user is logged has critical importance. In order to get information about how the relevant user is logged, we need to find the last log record of this user with EventID 4624 in EventLogs and check the Logon Type Value there. Let's write the script that will achieve this purpose together:

```powershell
Invoke-Expression -Command 'query user'

$LoggedUsers = (Invoke-Expression -Command 'query user') -replace '^>', '' | ForEach-Object {
	if ($_ -match '(?\S+)\s+console') {
		$Matches['username']
	}
}

$LoggedUsers | ForEach-Object {
	$username = $_

	$logEvents = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{Logname='Security'; ID=4624} |
	ForEach-Object {
		$xml = [xml]$_.ToXml()

		if (($xmlEventUsername = $xml.Event.EventData.Data | ? { $_.Name -eq 'TargetUserName' } | % { $_.'#text' }) -eq $username) {
			[PSCustomObject]@{
				Username = $username
				LogonType = $xml.Event.EventData.Data | ? { $_.Name -eq 'LogonType' } | % { $_.'#text' }
			}
		}
	}

	$logEvents | Select-Object -Last 1
}
```

In our script, we first get a list of active users. Then, by taking the usernames in the USERNAME section of this list one by one, we find the last 4624 events of these usernames in the EventLogs, and finally, we extract the Logon Type data from this record.

What we need to know when interpreting this data is Windows' logon types. For example, 2 means interactive (console) login, 3 means network login, 10 means remote desktop login.

Now our output is as follows:

## LSASS Accesses

On Windows systems, LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) memory dump is often associated with malicious activities aimed at extracting credentials from memory. A good starting point is usually to check system logs and running processes to determine if LSASS has memory dumped.

In Windows, when a process memory dump is taken, an event is raised with Event ID 1000 (Application Error). So, the first step may be to control such events. This can be done using PowerShell as follows:

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Application';ID=1000}
```

This output will probably have a high False Positive ratio because many application errors are logged with this event ID. Therefore, you may need to filter the results further.

  

## WMI Activities

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is often used to retrieve system information, perform actions on processes and services, and even run code. Malicious actors can abuse these capabilities, which is why WMI incidents are often scrutinized when responding to a cybersecurity incident.

Windows' WMI event logs contain many different types of events, but generally the most interesting are the events recorded when a new process is created via WMI activity, or when a service is stopped or started via WMI activity. The PowerShell `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet can be used to examine the WMI event log:

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational'}
```

Use of this command returns the 'Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational' log. However, this log can often be very large and contain large amounts of information, so it is often a good idea to filter the results further. For example, you can only search for events with a specific EventID or events within a specific time period.

Additionally, processes created via WMI typically use the **Create method of the Win32_Process** WMI class . This is typically recorded in an event log when a transaction is created. To look for such events, you can use a command to filter events in the WMI event log and return only events containing **Win32_Process** and **Create** .

Finally, many malicious WMI activities are associated with a specific process, such as PowerShell or cmd.exe. Therefore, it is often useful to look for WMI events involving such operations. However, this type of search can often return a large number of false positives because these processes are often used for legitimate activities as well.

As a result, reviewing WMI event logs is often useful when responding to a cybersecurity incident. However, this type of analysis must often be combined with a number of other forensic analysis techniques.

When scanning WMI events with PowerShell, we can focus on some of the most common and most abused event IDs. For example, 5861 and 5859 are typically triggered when a WMI activity type is started and completed.

The following PowerShell code snippet can be used to detect suspicious WMI events:

```powershell
# Event IDs
$suspiciousEventIDs = 5861, 5859

#GetEvents
$events = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational'; ID=$suspiciousEventIDs} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

#CreateLoop
foreach ($event in $events)
{
	# Set format to XML
	$xml = [xml]$event.ToXml()

		# If event found…
	if ($xml.Event.EventData.Data -contains 'Win32_Process' -or $xml.Event.EventData.Data -contains 'Create')
	{
		Write-Output ("Time: " + $event.TimeCreated)
		Write-Output ("Event ID: " + $event.Id)
		Write-Output ("Description: " + $event.Message)
		Write-Output ("--------------------------------------------- ----")
	}
}
```

This scripts pulls events from **the Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational log** with specific event IDs (here; 5861 and 5859). Of these events, those involving **Win32_Process** or **Create** are considered potentially malicious events and are displayed.

This script identifies suspicious events by translating each event into an XML object and then looking at specific data in the XML. XML allows you to examine the content of an event in more detail.

There is no guarantee that this snippet will detect all suspicious WMI activity from all logs of any system. Instead, it can be used as a starting point to identify the most common types of suspicious activity. Specifically, it looks for events containing the terms **Win32_Process** and **Create** . This is typically triggered when a new process is created via a WMI event. However, this search may miss other potentially suspicious WMI activity. Therefore, this code snippet should be used as a starting point and customized to the specific situation or threat model.

In this part of the training, we have covered how to conduct forensic analysis processes with PowerShell and made some practical exercises. In the next part of the training, we will continue on the " **Forensic Analysis and Incident Response with Powershell** ".
