PowerShell is a command line shell designed and developed by Microsoft to support Windows, MacOS and Linux operating systems. This specifically means that it is possible to write a single PowerShell script and run it on different platforms. However, you need to consider some important factors when creating cross-platform scripts.

The most important factor that you should consider when creating cross-platform scripts, is the architectural differences of the operating system on which your script will run. For example, the naming of file and directory paths in the Windows operating system is different from Linux and MacOs systems. Also, the authorization levels required for certain tasks are different in each operating system. For example, in Windows operating systems, you can access the list of running processes with user rights, while in Linux systems, administrator rights may be required in some cases.

You should take these into account in Powershell scripts when you design to run on multiple platforms, and predict how the operations you will perform in your script will react on which operating system. You can develop portable scripts by adding various controls for this type of critical operations.

Let's see these important points in detail:

  

## Checking PowerShell Version

The version of PowerShell affects the features and cmdlets available. While PowerShell 5.1 was released as part of Windows, PowerShell 7 (formerly PowerShell Core) is Microsoft's open source version that runs on a variety of platforms. Cmdlets that perform some tasks may be named differently in different Powershell versions. Some cmdlets may not be available in every Powershell version. Another version-related issue is the parameters we use in cmdlets. Some parameters may not be accepted in different Powershell versions.

This may require ensuring that a specific PowerShell version is used, such as:

```powershell
# Check Powershell Version
if ($PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major -lt 7) {
	Write-Output "This script requires PowerShell 7 or Greater"
	exit
}
```

## Checking Platform-Specific Commands

Some PowerShell cmdlets or features only work on a specific operating system. In this case, it is important to check the operating system and create scripts accordingly.

```powershell
#Check OS
if ($IsWindows) {
    # Windows specific code
} elseif ($IsLinux) {
    # Linux specific code
} elseif ($IsMacOS) {
    # macOS specific code
}
```

Let's try to understand it better with an example.

In the previous sections, we wrote a script for Windows that takes the list of processes running in the system, checks their hash values in VirusTotal, and if it finds a suspicious hash value, sends it as a notification to the Slack channel. Now let's rearrange this script to work multiplatform.

```powershell
# VirusTotal API key
$apiKey = 'YourVirusTotalApiKey'

# Check Os
if ($IsWindows) {
   # Windows Style Process List
	$processes = Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Path } | ForEach-Object { $_.Path }
} elseif ($IsLinux -or $IsMacOS) {
    # Unix Style Process List
	$processes = bash ps -eo cmd | ForEach-Object { $_.Trim() }
} else {
	Write-Output "Unknown Operating System. Script ended."
	exit
}

foreach ($process in $processes) {
    # Get File Hash
	try {
		$hash = Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -Path $process
	} catch {
		Write-Output "An error occurred while retrieving the file hash: $_"
		continue
	}

	# VirusTotal Query
	try {
		$uri = "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/$($hash.Hash)"
		$headers = @{ 'x-apikey' = $apiKey }
		$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Method 'Get' -Uri $uri -Headers $headers

		# Check file score
			if ($response.data.attributes.last_analysis_stats.malicious -gt 0) {
			Write-Output "Suspicious file found: $process ($($hash.Hash))"
		}
	} catch {
		Write-Output "An error occurred during VirusTotal Query: $_"
	}
}
```

Let's do another example. This time, let's get the list of Ports in the listening state on the system where the script runs:

```powershell
$os = $PSVersionTable.OS
$report = @()

if ($os -match 'Windows') {
    #WindowsStyle
	$connections = Get-NetTCPConnection | Where-Object { $_.State -eq 'Listen' }
		
	foreach ($conn in $connections) {
		$process = Get-Process -Id $conn.OwningProcess -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
		$report += New-Object PSObject -Property @{
			Protocol = $conn.Protocol
			LocalAddress = $conn.LocalAddress
			LocalPort = $conn.LocalPort
			ProcessName = $process.Name
		}
	}
} elseif ($os -match 'Linux' -or $os -match 'Darwin') {
    # UnixStyle
	$connections = bash -c "sudo netstat -plnt" | Where-Object { $_ -match 'LISTEN' }
		
	foreach ($conn in $connections) {
		if ($conn -match '\s*(\S+)\s+\S+\s+(\S+):(\S+)\s+\S+\s+\S+\s+(\S+).+') {
			$report += New-Object PSObject -Property @{
				Protocol = $Matches[1]
				LocalAddress = $Matches[2]
				LocalPort = $Matches[3]
				ProcessName = ($Matches[4] -split '/')[1]
			}
		}
	}
} else {
	Write-Error "This script is designed to run on Windows, Linux and MacOS."
}

$report | Format-Table
```

As you can see from the examples, the key to writing error-free portable scripts is to master the commands in the operating systems where our script is likely to run, and to proceed by checking them within the script when necessary.

  

## File Path and Separators

Different operating systems may differ in file path delimiters and file structure. PowerShell offers some features for cross-platform compatibility in this regard. For example, the **Join-Path** cmdlet allows you to use the correct file path separator across different platforms.

```powershell
$filePath = Join-Path -Path $env:USERPROFILE -ChildPath 'Documents\file.txt'
```

The **Join-Path** cmdlet is very useful when creating cross-platform scripts because it understands your operating system's file path format. That means it avoids cross-platform incompatibilities, especially those you might encounter when manually merging file paths.

For example, in Linux the file path separator character is “ **/** ”, while in Windows it is “ **\** ”. The **Join-Path** cmdlet uses the correct separator character depending on the operating system it is running on.

Let's start with a simple example. Let's say you need to generate the full path to a particular file. We know that this file is on the “C:” drive, in the “users” folder, in the “Admin” subfolder, and the name of the file is “document.txt”.

```powershell
$drive = "C:"
$folder = "Users\Admin"
$file = "document.txt"

$path = Join-Path -Path (Join-Path -Path $drive -ChildPath $folder) -ChildPath $file
```

This script sets the `$path` variable to `C:\Users\Admin\document.txt`.

The **Join-Path** cmdlet is often used in conjunction with other PowerShell cmdlets that operate on file paths, as well as creating complex file path hierarchies. These cmdlets include **Get-Content** , **Set-Content`** , **Copy-Item** , **Remove-Item** and many more. When you work with these cmdlets using `Join-Path`, you can create file paths in a neater and less error-prone manner.

Let’s make a more specific exercise and understand the use and importance of **Join-Path** in detail. In Linux, Windows and MacOS operating systems, the hierarchy of users' Home directories on the disk is different. However, by using **Join-Path** , we can read the content.txt file in the Home directory of the user running the script, regardless of the system on which our script runs, without being affected by these changes:

```powershell
# Get User Home Path
$homeDirectory = Resolve-Path ~

# Find content.txt under Documents
$filePath = Join-Path -Path (Join-Path -Path $homeDirectory -ChildPath "Documents") -ChildPath "content.txt"

# Read content.txt under Documents
$content = Get-Content -Path $filePath

# Print content.txt under Documents
$content
```

## Conclusion

Powershell is a scripting language with different versions that can run on different operating systems. However, in order to use the ability to work on these different platforms, we need to know how to make checks such as the Operating System and Powershell version, as well as the commands and features specific to the operating system on which our script will run. If we know about all these details and differences we should better be able to create scripts that are capable of running multiple platforms. We wish you all trouble-free scripts.
