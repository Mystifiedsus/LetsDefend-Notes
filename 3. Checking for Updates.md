With PowerShell, we can check if there are any updates that need to be applied on our system and report the results. You can see how we can use the Update Session feature for this in the example below:

```powershell
$updateSession = New-Object -ComObject Microsoft.Update.Session
$updateSearcher = $updateSession.CreateUpdateSearcher()

$updatesToDownload = New-Object -ComObject Microsoft.Update.UpdateColl

$searchResult = $updateSearcher.Search("IsInstalled=0 and Type='Software'")

if ($searchResult.Updates.Count -eq 0) {
	Write-Output "No updates to install."
} else {
	Write-Output "$($searchResult.Updates.Count) updates to install."

	$searchResult.Updates | ForEach-Object {
		Write-Output ("Title: " + $_.Title)
		Write-Output ("Description: " + $_.Description)
		Write-Output ("IsDownloaded: " + $_.IsDownloaded)
		Write-Output ("------------------")
	}
}
```

When we run this script, we get the output as follows:

As we did it in the examples above, we can run it periodically through a scheduled task and ask it to notify us, for example, through the Slack channel, if there is an update that has not been installed. For this, we just need to make a small change in the script:

```powershell
# Slack webhook URL
$slackWebhookUrl = ""

$updateSession = New-Object -ComObject Microsoft.Update.Session
$updateSearcher = $updateSession.CreateUpdateSearcher()

$updatesToDownload = New-Object -ComObject Microsoft.Update.UpdateColl

$searchResult = $updateSearcher.Search("IsInstalled=0 and Type='Software'")

if ($searchResult.Updates.Count -eq 0) {
	Write-Output "No updates to install."
} else {
	Write-Output "$($searchResult.Updates.Count) updates to install."

	$searchResult.Updates | ForEach-Object {
		Invoke-RestMethod -Method 'Post' -Uri $slackWebhookUrl -Body (ConvertTo-Json -InputObject $_.Title)
	}
}
```

In this part of the training, we have seen the basic approaches on how we can automate the security checks on our systems using PowerShell. You can apply what you learn here to the features and needs in your own environment.
