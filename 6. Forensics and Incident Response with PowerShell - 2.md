## Applications

Another important information about forensic analysis is the applications installed in the system and their details. We can access these with WMI via Powershell. What we need is to pay attention to here is that some applications may not appear in the "Installed Apps" list due to the way how they are installed. So it's important to do a second check by looking at the “Uninstall Registry” section in the Registry:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * from Win32_Product" | Select-Object -Property Name,Vendor,Version
```

```powershell
Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\* | Select-Object DisplayName, DisplayVersion, Publisher, InstallDate
```

The output of these two commands will be similar to the following:

Another important issue when performing forensic analysis is the status of updates on the system. It would be helpful to get a list of installed updates.

```powershell
Get-HotFix | Format-Table -AutoSize
```

When it comes to forensic analysis, the list of uninstalled updates is as important as the installed update packages. Because this list will give us very valuable information about which vulnerability the attacker may have exploited.

With Powershell, we can check if there are any unapplied updates on our system and report the results. You can see how we can use the Update Session feature for this in the example below:

```powershell
$updateSession = New-Object -ComObject Microsoft.Update.Session
$updateSearcher = $updateSession.CreateUpdateSearcher()

$updatesToDownload = New-Object -ComObject Microsoft.Update.UpdateColl

$searchResult = $updateSearcher.Search("IsInstalled=0 and Type='Software'")

if ($searchResult.Updates.Count -eq 0) {
	Write-Output "No updates to install."
} else {
	Write-Output "$($searchResult.Updates.Count) updates to install."

	$searchResult.Updates | ForEach-Object {
	Write-Output ("Title: " + $_.Title)
	Write-Output ("Description: " + $_.Description)
	Write-Output ("IsDownloaded: " + $_.IsDownloaded)
	Write-Output ("------------------")
	}
}
```

When we run this script, we get output as follows:

## Automatically Running Applications

There are many ways to enable some applications to run automatically at system startup in the Windows operating system, and attackers often use these ways to gain persistence in the system. The following script outputs a list of executable applications programmed for this type of autorun in areas that we can control with powershell:

```powershell
# Startup Items
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_StartupCommand
# Startup Folder
Get-ChildItem -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"
#Services
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.StartType -eq 'Automatic'}
#Drivers
Get-WmiObject Win32_SystemDriver | Where-Object {$_.StartMode -eq 'Auto'}
# Registry
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run'
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce'
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run'
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce'

# Scheduled Tasks
Get-ScheduledTask | Where-Object {$_.Settings.StartWhenAvailable -eq $true -and $_.State -ne "Disabled"}
```

We should bear in mind that the areas that attackers can use to gain persistence in the Windows operating system are not limited to these and it is not possible to control all of them with PowerShell. There is enough content in this list to start with, but in cases where we need to deepen the investigation, you may need to include tools that allow more detailed analysis, such as the Autoruns tool from SysInternals tools.

  
## Conclusion

As we mentioned at the beginning, each event has its own unique structure and therefore each event may contain different inputs and outputs specific to that event. Powershell is a powerful tool that will benefit us in this process. For example, we can combine what we did above and more into a script like the one below and quickly create an archive as we start examining:

```powershell
# Analyze-System.ps1

# Download and Prepare procdump
# Note: EndPoint protection tools may consider procdump.exe as malicious.
# So you may need to define exception
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://download.sysinternals.com/files/Procdump.zip" -OutFile ".\Procdump.zip"

Expand-Archive -Path ".\Procdump.zip" -DestinationPath ".\Procdump"


my money(
[DateTime]$StartTime = (Get-Date).AddDays(-1),
[DateTime]$EndTime = (Get-Date)
)

# Prepare export folder
$hostname = $env:COMPUTERNAME
$timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd_HHmmss"
$outputPath = ".\$($hostname)_$($timestamp)_analyze"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $outputPath | Out-Null

# Function to export data to CSV
function ExportToCSV($data, $fileName) {
$data | Export-Csv -Path (Join-Path -Path $outputPath -ChildPath "$fileName.csv") -NoTypeInformation
}

# Get event logs
$eventLogs = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashTable @{LogName='Application'; StartTime=$StartTime; EndTime=$EndTime}
$eventLogs += Get-WinEvent -FilterHashTable @{LogName='System'; StartTime=$StartTime; EndTime=$EndTime}
$eventLogs += Get-WinEvent -FilterHashTable @{LogName='Security'; StartTime=$StartTime; EndTime=$EndTime}
ExportToCSV -data $eventLogs -fileName "EventLogs"

# Get LSASS memory dump
# Note: This requires procdump.exe to be available on the system, and the script to be run as administrator
& .\procdump\procdump.exe -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmp
Move-Item -Path .\lsass.dmp -Destination $outputPath

# Get active process hashes
# Note: This requires Sysinternals suite to be available on the system
$processes = Get-Process

# Start Foreach loop for process list
foreach ($process in $processes) {

# Find current process path
$filePath = $process.MainModule.FileName
if ($filePath) {
	$hashes= {Get-FileHash $filePath}
}
}

ExportToCSV -data $hashes -fileName "ProcessHashes"


# Get DLL and EXE hashes
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Windows, C:\Windows\System32 -Include *.dll, *.exe -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
$hashes = $files | ForEach-Object {Get-FileHash $_.FullName}
ExportToCSV -data $hashes -fileName "FileHashes"

# Get directory metadata
$directories = Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Windows, C:\Windows\System32 -Recurse -Directory -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
ExportToCSV -data $directories -fileName "DirectoryMetadata"

# Get listening ports and applications
$ports = Get-NetTCPConnection | Where-Object {$_.State -eq 'Listen'}
ExportToCSV -data $ports -fileName "ListeningPorts"

# Get logged in users and login types
# Note: This requires the 'logon' module to be available on the system
$loggedInUsers = Get-LoggedOnUser | Where-Object {($_.LogonTime -ge $StartTime) -and ($_.LogonTime -le $EndTime)}
ExportToCSV -data $loggedInUsers -fileName "LoggedInUsers"

# Get installed applications
$installedApps = Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*
ExportToCSV -data $installedApps -fileName "InstalledApps"

# Get installed updates
$installedUpdates = Get-Hotfix
ExportToCSV -data $installedUpdates -fileName "InstalledUpdates"

# Get pending updates
# Note: This requires the 'PSWindowsUpdate' module to be available on the system
$pendingUpdates = Get-WUList
ExportToCSV -data $pendingUpdates -fileName "PendingUpdates"

# Get auto-start applications
$autoStartApps = Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_StartupCommand
ExportToCSV -data $autoStartApps -fileName "AutoStartApps"

# Get computer info
$computerInfo = Get-ComputerInfo
ExportToCSV -data $computerInfo -fileName "ComputerInfo"

# Compress output folder
Compress-Archive -Path $outputPath -DestinationPath "$outputPath.zip"

# Delete output folder
Remove-Item -Path $outputPath -Recurse -Force
```

When our script runs, it first creates a directory with the name of the system it is running on and date and time information, saves the collected information in the form of files in this directory, and it compresses the folder in zip format, and deletes it upon completion. You can move the resulting zip file to any environment you want and continue your analysis there.

As you can guess, all the scripts we use in this course, including this script, are not scripts that we recommend you use directly in the production environment, our aim is only to give an idea about what can be done.

We hope that by the end of this training series, you will be able to incorporate powershell into your skillset.

  

In this part of the training, we have covered the forensic analysis processes with PowerShell and made some practical exercises to consolidate what we have learned.
